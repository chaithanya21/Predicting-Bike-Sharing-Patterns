# Predicting-Bike-Sharing-Patterns
<h2>Project Overview</h2>
Building and Training a Artificial Neural Network(ANN) From Scratch To Predict The Number Of BikeShare Users On a Given Day.Predicting the number of bikeshare riders on a given day is very useful for a bikesharing company Because they want know how many bikes they really need,which can help solve two Potential Problems for the Comapany:
<br>

<li><b>If The Company Has Too Few Bikes,Then The Company Will Be Loosing Money From The Potential Riders.</b></li>

<li><b>If The Company Has Too Many Bikes, Then They Wil Be Wasting Money On Bikes That Are Simply sitting Around.</b></li>
<br>



 Hence the Company has to Know how many bikes it needs in the near future,One of the best ways to predict is by looking at the Historical Data of the Company, A Neural Network model is built from the ground up before going to the higher level implementations of Tensorflow,Pytorch or other Deep Learning frameworks,it also helps to have higher level Understanding of forward propogation,gradient descent,backpropagation etc.
